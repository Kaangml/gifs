GIFs: Optimization Algorithms Visualized
This repository contains Python implementations and visualizations of various optimization algorithms. Each algorithm folder includes:

Python code to implement the algorithm.

Animated GIF showing how the algorithm progresses step by step.

All these visualizations have been created as part of my contributions to the KÃ¼re Encyclopedia Platform to help readers better understand the mechanics behind optimization algorithms.

(Feel free to update with more algorithms or change GIF paths if necessary)

ðŸ›  Requirements
To run any of the scripts and generate animations, install the required Python libraries:

pip install -r requirements.txt

All animations illustrate how optimization algorithms minimize a simple quadratic function to visually track their update paths.

You can modify the function or parameters inside each script to explore different behaviors.
