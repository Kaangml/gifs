## GIFs: Optimization Algorithms Visualized
This repository contains Python implementations and visualizations of various optimization algorithms. Each algorithm folder includes:

Python code to implement the algorithm.

Animated GIF showing how the algorithm progresses step by step.

All these visualizations have been created as part of my contributions to the KÃ¼re Encyclopedia Platform to help readers better understand the mechanics behind optimization algorithms.

(Feel free to update with more algorithms or change GIF paths if necessary)

## Requirements
To run any of the scripts and generate animations, install the required Python libraries:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

All animations illustrate how optimization algorithms minimize a simple quadratic function to visually track their update paths.

You can modify the function or parameters inside each script to explore different behaviors.
